- MacMahon currently shoots the snail bullets, instead of the MC
- The titlescreen art is squashed vertically
- Might be good to have enemies that take more than one hit to defeat? Such as the melee ones. Possibly decrease speed a bit as a trade-off?
- Display graphics at 2x size
- Slow bomb feels a little disruptive to gameplay? A way to use it and have it take effect instantly instead of pausing the game, maybe playing the animation somewhere on the map instead, might feel better
