- MacMahon currently shoots the snail bullets, instead of the MC
- The titlescreen art is squashed vertically
- Might be good to have enemies that take more than one hit to defeat? Such as the melee ones. Possibly decrease speed a bit as a trade-off?
- Display graphics at 2x size
- Slow bomb feels a little disruptive to gameplay? A way to use it and have it take effect instantly instead of pausing the game, maybe playing the animation somewhere on the map instead, might feel better
- Fix diagonal movement speed
- Make slow bomb decrease rate of fire instead of bullet speed?
- Adjust difficulty curve by having fewer enemies at start, gradually increase. If needed, make boss require a few more kills to spawn for balance. 
- Fix 'costum_property' turning collision on instead of causing layer to render over playr/enemies
- Fix movement bug where moving in one direction, then quickly pressing the key for the opposite direction causes player to get stuck briefly
- Fix bug with knockback where getting hit by multiple enemies(?) teleports player to corner of map, sometimes causing player to be stuck behind wall
- Make bullets fire from center of character
- Render slow bomb animation small without pausing, but briefly show a transparent colored (light green-brown?) overlay over rest of screen
- Add music and sound effects
